# Todo List

## Search
* Search box will lead to a search page with the query and types of content (file, course, user) to look for as seen in grafikart.fr

## Roles (done)
* Define a clear role pattern (using entrust package)
> * Each method has a Permission (create user, edit pole, add file etc...)

<!-- List permission in roles.edit/create and use checkboxes-->
